Scripts that are standalone, require only minimal to no dependencies, and inspire using fundamentals.

I am an integrator.  That is not to say that I can't pick apart your code and understand a majority of it's functionality.  As a result, over the years I have grown tired of integrating and debugging code that has gone pear shaped due to the engineer's lack of understanding the fundamentals of the problem domain they are working in.

Here I am hoping to provide a collection of interesting scripts that stand on their own with dependencies that can be satisfied with a minimal linux operating system.  If it's python based, likely you will only need stock python.  If there are dependencies beyond stock python, it is my intention that they should be few.

Enjoy!
